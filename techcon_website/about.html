            <h2><b>History</b></h2>
            <p>TechCon began in 2015 as a small meetup of passionate developers and tech enthusiasts eager
               to share knowledge and ideas. Originally hosted in a local co-working space, the event quickly 
               gained momentum due to its inclusive atmosphere and focus on emerging technologies. Over the 
               years, TechCon has evolved into a global conference attracting thousands of participants from 
               around the world. With each edition, it has expanded to include keynote speeches from industry 
               leaders, hands-on workshops, startup showcases, and cutting-edge tech exhibitions — becoming a 
               hub for innovation, collaboration, and future-forward thinking.</p>
